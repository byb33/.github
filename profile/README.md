BYB 33 Wolverhampton Brawl is headlined by a pair of world title matchups as Marko Martinjak takes on Brad Scott for the BYB Super Cruiserweight Police Gazette Diamond Belt and Dan Podmore and Ryan Barrett face off for the Police Gazette Bridgerweight Police Gazette Diamond Belt.

Martinjak (10-2, Zagreb, Croatia) is no stranger to BYB‚Äôs mighty Trigon, having fought a three-continent Trilogy for the Police Gazette World Diamond Belt in Dubai, London and the US, respectively, besting Jarome Hatch 2 fights to 1. He is a multi-time and multi-division champion.  He held the BKB super middleweight, light heavyweight and cruiserweight world titles, held two Police Gazette World Diamond Police Belts (currently owning the super cruiserweight belt), and was the first Men‚Äôs Police Gazette World Double Diamond Police Belt holder. 

The undefeated Scott (3-0-1, Bath, Somerset, UK), a former UFC mixed martial artist, has three stoppages in his bare knuckle three victories, and was the BKB British Cruiserweight champion before the company‚Äôs acquisition by BYB.

Podmore (6-3, Birmingham, West Midlands, UK) and Barrett (5-4 Coalville, Leicestershire, UK) had previously faced off in 2022 under the BKB umbrella with Podmore winning by TKO. Podmore has held the BKB World Heavyweight and Cruiserweight titles, and was the first fighter to hold the Police Gazette World Diamond Heavyweight and Cruiserweight Belts.  Barrett defeated Richie Samuels for the British Super Middleweight title in June.
